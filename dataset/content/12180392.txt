A function relates an input to an output.


It is like a machine that has an input and an output.
And the output is related somehow to the input.
"f(x) = ... " is the classic way of writing a function.
And there are other ways, as you will see!
We will see many ways to think about functions, but there are always   three main parts:
Here are the three parts:
For an input of 50, what is the output?
But we are not going to look at specific functions ...
... instead  we will look at the general idea of a function.
First, it is useful to give a function a name.
The most common name is "f", but we can have other names like "g" ... or even "marmalade" if we want.
But let's use "f":

We say "f of x equals x squared"
what goes into the function is put inside parentheses () after the name of the function:
So f(x) shows us the function is called "f", and "x" goes in
And we usually see what a function does with the input:
f(x) = x2 shows us that function "f" takes "x" and squares it.
 
Example: with  f(x) = x2:
In fact we can write f(4) = 16.
 
Don't get too concerned about "x", it is just there to show us where the input goes and what happens to it.
It could be anything!
So this function:
f(x) = 1 - x + x2
Is  the same function as:
The variable (x, q, A, etc)  is just there so we know where to put the values:
f(2) = 1 - 2 + 22 = 3
 
Sometimes a function has no name, and we   see something like:
y = x2
But there is still:
At the top we said that a function was like a machine. But a function doesn't really have belts or cogs or any moving parts - and it doesn't actually destroy what we put into it!
A function relates an input to an output.
Saying "f(4) = 16" is like saying 4 is somehow related to 16. Or 4 â 16

Example: this tree grows 20 cm every year, so the height of the tree is related to its age using the function h:
h(age) = age Ã 20
So, if the age is 10 years, the height is:
h(10) = 10 Ã 20 = 200 cm
Here are some example values:
 
"Numbers" seems an obvious answer, but ...
... which numbers?
For example,  the tree-height function h(age) = ageÃ20 makes no sense for an  age less than zero.
So we need something more powerful, and that is where sets come in:
Here are some examples:
Each individual thing in the set (such as "4" or "hat") is called a member, or element.
So, a function takes elements of a set, and gives back elements of a set.
But a function has special rules:
This can be said in one definition:

A function  relates each element of a set
with exactly one element of another
      set
(possibly the same set).
 
1.
"...each element..." means that every element in X is related to some element in Y.
We say that the function covers X (relates every element of it).
(But some elements of Y might not be related to at all, which is   fine.)
2.
"...exactly one..." means that a function  is single valued. It will not give back 2 or more results for the same input.
So "f(2) = 7 or 9" is not right!
"One-to-many" is not allowed, but "many-to-one" is allowed:
When a relationship does not follow those two rules then it is not a function ... it is still  a relationship, just not a function.

Could also be written as a table:
It is a function, because:
So it follows the rules.
(Notice how both 4 and -4 relate to 16, which is allowed.)

It is a relationship, but it is not a function, for these reasons:
(But the fact that "6" in Y has no relationship does not matter)
 

On a graph, the idea of single valued means that no vertical line  ever crosses more than one value.
If it crosses more than once it is still a valid curve, but is not a function.
Some types of functions have stricter rules, to find out more  you can read Injective, Surjective and Bijective
My examples have just a few values, but  functions usually work on sets with infinitely many elements.
We can't show  ALL the values, so here are  just a few  examples:
 
In  our examples above
We have a special page on Domain, Range and Codomain if you want to know more.
Functions have been used in mathematics for a very long time, and lots of different names and ways of writing functions have come about.
Here are some common terms you should get familiar with:


We often call a function "f(x)" when in fact the function is really "f"
And here is another way to think about functions:
Write the input and output of a function  as an  "ordered pair",  such as (4,16).
They are called  ordered pairs because the input always comes first, and the output second:
(input, output)
So it looks like this:
( x, f(x) )
Example:
(4,16) means that the function takes in "4" and gives out "16"
A function can then be defined as  a set of ordered pairs:
Example: {(2,4), (3,5), (7,3)} is a function that says
"2 is related to 4", "3 is related to 5" and "7 is related 3".
Also, notice that:
But the function has to be single valued, so we also say
"if it contains (a, b) and (a, c), then b must equal  c"
Which is just a way of saying that an input of "a" cannot produce two different results.
Example: {(2,4), (2,5), (7,3)} is not a function because {2,4} and {2,5} means that 2 could be related to 4 or 5.
In other words it is not a function because it is not single valued

We can graph them...
... because they are also coordinates!
So a set of coordinates is also a function (if they follow  
        the rules above, that is)
 
We can create functions that behave differently depending on the input value
Read more at Piecewise Functions.
One last topic: the terms "explicit" and "implicit".
Explicit is when the function shows us how to go directly from x to y, such as:
y =  x3 â 3
When we know x, we can find y
That is the classic y = f(x) style that we often work with.
Implicit is when it is not given directly such as:
x2 â 3xy + y3 = 0
When we know x, how do we find y?
It may be hard (or impossible!) to go directly from x to y.
"Implicit" comes from "implied", in other words shown indirectly.
