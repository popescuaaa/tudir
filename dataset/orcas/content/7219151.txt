US Passports can now use X for gender marker (posted 3/31/2022)
"The U.S. State Department is now taking further steps toward demonstrating their commitment to better serve all U.S. citizens, regardless of gender identity," reads a statement on the U.S. Department of State website for passports. "You can now self-select the gender you want printed on your U.S. passport. If you are applying for a U.S. passport book via routine service, the X gender marker will be available starting April 11, 2022. We are also making technological updates to make the X gender marker available on passport cards, emergency passport books printed at embassies and consulates, expedited and emergency passports issued at passport agencies and centers, and Consular Reports of Birth Abroad (CRBAs)."The website continues with questions and answers: Why did the U.S. Department of State add the Gender X marker for U.S. passport applicants?"We are committed to promoting the freedom, dignity, and equality of all people  including LGBTQI+ individuals." "Selecting your Gender Marker: You can select the gender marker you would like printed on your U.S. passport. The gender you select does not need to match the gender on your supporting documentation such as a birth certificate, previous passport, or state ID. We no longer require medical documentation to change the gender marker on your U.S. passport.Beginning April 11, 2022, you can select male (M), female (F), or unspecified or another gender identity (X) as your gender marker if you are applying for a U.S. passport book and selecting routine service. Beginning in late 2023, you will be able to select X as a marker if you are seeking a passport card or selecting expedited service. By late 2023, we anticipate completing additional technological updates so that the X gender marker will be available on the following documents we issue:	Passport cards	Emergency passports printed at embassies and consulates 	Expedited and emergency passports issued at passport agencies and centers, and	Consular Reports of Birth Abroad (CRBAs)It means you can select the gender you would like us to print on your U.S. passport, by selecting male (M), female (F), or unspecified or another gender identity (X), starting April 11, 2022. You no longer need to provide medical certification or a physicians letter if the gender marker you select for your U.S. passport does not match the gender on your citizenship evidence or photo ID. Your citizenship evidence or identification document does not need to match the gender you are requesting. Here is what the State Department says regarding safety and security in countries LGBTQI people may which to travel with an X gender marker passport: LGBTQI+ Travelers: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) travelers can face unique challenges when traveling abroad.  Laws and attitudes in some countries may affect safety and ease of travel.  Legal protections vary from country to country.  Many countries do not legally recognize same-sex marriage.  Approximately seventy countries consider consensual same-sex sexual relations a crime, sometimes carrying severe punishment.Related Links:Selecting Your Gender Marker U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular AffairsLGBTQI+ Traveler Info U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs
Roadside Geology Map available for Yellowstone National Park (posted 3/31/2022)U.S. Geological Society
Yellowstone became the worlds first national park in 1872. The unique geology found inside the park is a big attraction, bringing millions of tourists to Wyoming every year. However, the Cowboy State has plenty of other fascinating geology to see on the way to the park.In celebration of the 150th anniversary of Yellowstone National Park, the Wyoming State Geological Survey (WSGS) developed an interactive web map showcasing some of the roadside geology along different routes throughout the state on the way to Yellowstone. The web-based application can be viewed on mobile device or desktop and is free to access."From Old Faithful to the Mammoth Terraces, there is incredible geology found in the park," says Christina George, outreach and publications manager. "The goal of this map, however, is to highlight the unbelievable geology you can see as you are getting to the park, enhancing road trips for residents and visitors."More than 50 sites dot the map, ranging from well-known places like Devils Tower, to colorful badlands, meandering rivers, majestic mountain ranges, and remarkable rock formations. Some stops, such as state parks, have visitor centers or highway pullouts that can be accessed, while others, like the red beds north of Rawlins, are more suitable to view while simply driving by. There are interpretive signs at some of the sites, and many of the write-ups on the app include links to external websites that offer more information.George and James Amato created the app using ESRIs story builder, a web-based GIS platform."Whether or not youre going to Yellowstone, the app showcases many fantastic geologic points of interest across the state," says Amato, WSGS map editor.For those wanting to learn more about the geology inside the park, the WSGS has a Geology of Yellowstone interactive web map with multiple geospatial datasets relating to the geology of Yellowstone. The map was developed in cooperation with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, of which the WSGS is a consortium member."There are many hidden geologic gems in Wyoming," says Dr. Erin Campbell, Director of the WSGS and State Geologist. "Even a seasoned traveler can learn something new from this easy-to-use interactive map. We hope it enhances visitors enjoyment as they cross our spectacular state on their way to Yellowstone."


Data from the Wyoming Department of Health

Wyoming reports 27,357 COVID-19 breakthrough cases (posted 3/29/2022)
2,934 more cases since FebruaryPinedale Online!
On February 20, 2022, we posted a story that Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) reported the state had 24,423 breakthrough cases of COVID-19. Breakthrough cases are people who are fully vaccinated who have tested positive and confirmed to have been infected with the virus 14 or more days after completing their vaccine series.  On March 22nd, WDH reported the state had 26,359 breakthrough cases, an increase of over 1900 cases among vaccinated persons in a month. A week later on March 29th, they updated their data to show the state had 27,357 breakthrough cases. Thats an increase of 2,934 breakthrough cases in a month, and 998 more in a week. Thats a rate of more than 500 breakthrough cases per week in the state as of March 2022. There were ten deaths in the state during the month of March 2022 and hospitalizations due to the virus have dropped to 12 by the end of March. To date, two years into the pandemic, no one age 18 or under has died in Wyoming due to COVID-19. The state still shows a 98% overall recovery rate from the disease.Click on this link for more data graphs.Related Links:Wyoming Department of Health COVID-19 dataWyoming reports 24,423 COVID-19 breakthrough cases Pinedale Online!

COVID-19 vaccine bills being proposed in California (posted 3/28/2022)Will be voted on soonPinedale Online!
There is a suite of proposed new bills being proposed in California regarding COVID-19, vaccine mandates, and cracking down on misinformation about the virus and the vaccine. These proposed bills will be voted on within the next couple of weeks. They are being proposed by a Vaccine Working Group of Democratic state legislators. They include mandating vaccines for children and workers; to allow 12 to 17 years-olds to get the vaccine without parental consent; another would reclassify the sharing of COVID-19 "misinformation" by doctors and surgeons as unprofessional conduct that would result in disciplinary action. The founding members of the Vaccine Work Group include Senator Dr. Richard Pan, Senator Scott Weiner, Senator Josh Newman, Assemblymember Akilah Weber, MD, Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, and Assemblymember Evan Low. Proponents of the new bills say they will improve the states vaccination rate and crack down on misinformation about the virus and the vaccine. The reason this is worth being on the publics radar beyond California is because things that get passed through as law in California often work their way into other states. The bills: SB 871 - Schools: Vaccine MandateWould require all children 0 to 17 to get the COVID-19 vaccine to attend child care or schoolAuthor: Democratic Sen. Richard PanThis bill would require that all children age 0 - 17 get fully immunized with the COVID-19 vaccine to attend child care, day nursery, family day care home, development center, pre-school, or public or private K-12. It does not specify whether the vaccine must be approved by the Federal Drug Administration or for children under 5 before the requirement applies. The bill also would remove the personal belief exemption which allows parents to opt out of the vaccine for their child, for the COVID-19 vaccine, and eliminates the personal belief exemptions from any future vaccines the state Public Health Department adds to the list of required vaccines to attend school. The bill would impose a state-mandated local program. https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB871SB 866  Minors: Vaccine ConsentWould allow kids 12 to 17 to get the COVID-19 vaccine without parental consentAuthor: Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, of San FranciscoThis bill would allow children 12 to 17 to choose to take any vaccine available to their age group without parent or guardian consent. The goal is to allow teenagers who want the COVID-19 vaccine to get it independently to raise the vaccination rate among adolescents. https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB866SB 1479 - Schools: Continued COVID-19 Testing and Test PlansWould require schools to continue COVID-19 testing and to create testing plansAuthor: Democratic Sen. Richard Pan, of SacramentoThis bill would require school districts to continue COVID-19 testing for teachers, staff and students to stay open or reopen and to create COVID-19 testing plans for each of their school campuses, including preschools, child care sites and after-school programs. The bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Implementation is reliant on government funding so districts can have money to develop and implement the plans.https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1479SB 1018 - Social media misinformationWould require online platforms to be more transparent about how information is pushed out to consumersAuthor: Democratic Sen. Richard Pan, of Sacramento	This bill would require online platforms, such as Instagram, to be more transparent about how they use algorithms and what databases they interact with. The goal is to better understand how the platforms work and how information is pushed out to consumers. This bill would create a new "Office of Platform Accountability and Transparency." This bill would require a platform operator to disclose to the office, on or before July 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, among other things, certain information with respect to its use of algorithms and metrics, including a description of all product features that made use of algorithms during the previous calendar year. The bill would require the chairperson of the office to, on or before July 1, 2024, and annually thereafter, submit to the director and to the Legislature a report of the operations of the office, as provided. This bill would subject a violator of its provisions to a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for each violation that may be recovered only in a civil action brought by the Attorney General.https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1018SB 1464 - Law Enforcement: Enforcing Public Health Orders Would force law enforcement officials to enforce public health ordersAuthor: Democratic Sen. Richard Pan, of SacramentoThis bill would require law enforcement officials to enforce public health orders. Currently, law enforcement can enforce these orders if they choose to. If a police or sheriffs agency publicly announces or adopts a policy not to uphold public health orders, it would lose state funding. If funds are withheld, this bill would require those funds to instead be reallocated to the county public health department of the county in which the law enforcement agency operates for public health purposes.https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1464AB 1993 - Employment: COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate to work in CaliforniaWould require all employees, including independent contractors, to show proof of COVID-19 vaccine to work in CaliforniaAuthor: Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, of OaklandThis bill would mandate that employers require all workers and independent contractors to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. On January 1, 2023, each employer must affirm to the department all employees and independent contractors comply to the vaccine mandate. It does allow for medical and religious exemptions. The bill would require the department to impose a penalty of an unspecified amount on an employer for any violation of these provisions.https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1993AB 1797  Immunization RegistryWould make changes to the California Immunization Record DatabaseAuthor: Democratic Assembly member Akilah Weber, of San DiegoThis bill would change how the California Immunization Record database operates.  It would require vaccine providers, from doctors to pharmacists, to upload vaccination data to the registry for all children. Currently, some providers dont use the system. This bill would impose a state-mandated local program.  The bill would also show all vaccinations given to a student, not just those required to attend school, and would require reporting the race and ethnicity of children. This bill would additionally authorize schools, childcare facilities, family childcare homes, and county human services agencies to use the specified immunization information, in the event of a public health emergency, to perform immunization status assessments of pupils, adults, and clients.https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1797AB 2098  Physicians: Unprofessional ConductThis bill would designate the dissemination or promotion of misinformation or disinformation related to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, or "COVID-19," as unprofessional conductAuthor: Democratic Assemblymember Evan Low, of CupertinoThis bill aims to stop licensed doctors and surgeons from sharing what the government calls misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. It does that by classifying the distribution or promotion of misinformation or disinformation related to COVID-19 as "unprofessional conduct". This includes what the government considers to be false or misleading information regarding the nature and risks of the virus, its prevention and treatment; and the development, safety, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Physicians who do so risk losing their medical licenses or disciplinary action by governing medical boards.https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2098Related Links:California State Senator Dr. Richard Pan Vaccine Working Group, January 19, 2022California legislators propose new slate of COVID-19 vaccine laws By Elizabeth Aguilera, www.calmatters.org, March 2, 2022
