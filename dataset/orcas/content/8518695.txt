I was trying to understand how to use the WITH clause and the purpose of the WITH clause.
All I understood was, the WITH clause was a replacement for normal sub-queries.
Can anyone explain this to me with a small example in detail ?
The SQL WITH clause was introduced by Oracle in the Oracle 9i release 2 database. The SQL WITH clause allows you to give a sub-query block a name (a process also called sub-query refactoring), which can be referenced in several places within the main SQL query. The name assigned to the sub-query is treated as though it was an inline view or table. The SQL WITH clause is basically a drop-in replacement to the normal sub-query.
Syntax For The SQL WITH Clause
The following is the syntax of the SQL WITH clause when using a single sub-query alias.
When using multiple sub-query aliases, the syntax is as follows.
In the syntax documentation above, the occurrences of alias_name is a meaningful name you would give to the sub-query after the AS clause. Each sub-query should be separated with a comma Example for WITH statement. The rest of the queries follow the standard formats for simple and complex SQL SELECT queries.

This has been fully answered here. 
See Oracle's docs on SELECT to see how subquery factoring works, and Mark's example:
