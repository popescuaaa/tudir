The exclamation mark, !, also sometimes referred to as the exclamation point (American English), is a punctuation mark usually used after an interjection or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or to show emphasis. The exclamation mark often marks the end of a sentence, for example: "Watch out!". Similarly, a bare exclamation mark (with nothing before or after) is often established in warning signs.

The exclamation mark is often used in writing to make a character seem as though they are shouting and/or excited/surprised. It can also be used in fiction writing for a person who is doing the same thing but in real life.

Other uses include:

Graphically, the exclamation mark is represented by variations on the theme of a full stop point with a vertical line above. 

One theory of its origin posits derivation from a Latin exclamation of joy, namely io, analogous to "hurray"; the modern graphical representation is believed to have originated in the Middle Ages; medieval copyists wrote the Latin word io at the end of a sentence, to indicate expression of joy. Over time, the i moved above the o; that o first became smaller, and (with time) a dot.[2][page needed][3][page needed][better source needed]

The exclamation mark was first introduced into English printing in the 15th century to show emphasis, and was called the "sign of admiration or exclamation"[4] or the "note of admiration" until the mid-17th century;[5] "admiration" referred to that word's Latin-language sense, of wonderment.

Many pre-computer age typewriters did not have the exclamation mark. Instead the user typed a full stop and then backspaced and overtyped an apostrophe. Such typewriters often lacked a '1' key as well (the user typed a lower-case 'L'). That is why the exclamation point is usually shift+1 as both were added at the same time.[citation needed]

Now obsolete, the name ecphoneme was documented in the early 20th century.[6]

In the 1950s, secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as “bang”,[7][8] perhaps from comic books – where the ! appeared in dialogue balloons to represent a gun being fired,[9] although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing.[10] This “bang” usage is behind the names of the interrobang, an unconventional typographic character, and a shebang, a feature of Unix computer systems.

In the printing world, the exclamation mark can be called a screamer, a gasper, a slammer, or a startler.[11]

In hacker culture, the exclamation mark is called “bang”, “shriek”, or, in the British slang known as Commonwealth Hackish, “pling”. For example, the password communicated in the spoken phrase “Your password is em-zero-pee-aitch-bang-en-three” (“em-nought-pee-aitch-pling-en-three” in Commonwealth Hackish) is m0ph!n3.[12]

The exclamation mark is common to languages using the Latin alphabet, although usage varies slightly between languages. It has also been adopted in languages written in other scripts, such as languages written with Cyrillic or Arabic scripts, Chinese characters, and Devanagari.

A sentence ending in an exclamation mark may represent an exclamation or an interjection (such as "Wow!", "Boo!"), or an imperative ("Stop!"), or may indicate astonishment or surprise: "They were the footprints of a gigantic hound!" Exclamation marks are occasionally placed mid-sentence with a function similar to a comma, for dramatic effect, although this usage is obsolete: "On the walk, oh! there was a frightful noise."[13]

Informally, exclamation marks may be repeated for additional emphasis ("That's great!!!"), but this practice is generally considered unacceptable in formal prose.[14]

The exclamation mark is sometimes used in conjunction with the question mark. This can be in protest or astonishment ("Out of all places, the squatter-camp?!"); a few writers replace this with a single, nonstandard punctuation mark, the interrobang, which is the combination of a question mark and an exclamation mark.[15]

Overly frequent use of the exclamation mark is generally considered poor writing, as it distracts the reader and decreases the mark's significance.[16][17]

Cut out all these exclamation points... An exclamation point is like laughing at your own joke.
Some authors, most notably Tom Wolfe and Madison Acampora, are known for unashamedly liberal use of the exclamation mark. In comic books, the very frequent use of exclamation mark is common—see Comics, below.

For information on the use of spaces after an exclamation mark, see the discussion of spacing after a full stop.

Several studies have shown that women use exclamation marks more than men do. One study suggests that, in addition to other uses, exclamation marks may also function as markers of friendly interaction, for example, by making "Hi!" or "Good luck!" seem friendlier than simply "Hi." or "Good luck." (with periods).[19] However, use of exclamation marks in contexts that are not unambiguously positive can be misinterpreted as indicating hostility.

In English writing and often subtitles, a (!) symbol (an exclamation mark within parentheses) implies that a character has made an obviously sarcastic comment e.g.: "Ooh, a sarcasm detector. That's a really useful invention(!)"[20] It also is used to indicate surprise at one's own experience or statement.

In French, next to marking exclamations or indicating astonishment, the exclamation mark is also commonly used to mark orders or requests: Viens ici ! (English: 'Come here!'). When available, a 'narrow no-break space' (espace fine insécable) is used between the last word and the exclamation mark in European French. If not, a regular non-breaking space (espace insécable) is currently used. In Canadian French, either no space is used or a small space (espace fine insécable) is inserted if available.  One can also combine an exclamation mark with a question mark at the end of a sentence where appropriate.

German uses the exclamation mark for several things that English conveys with other punctuation:[21][22]



Cantonese has not historically used dedicated punctuation marks, rather relying on grammatical markers to denote the end of a statement. Usage of exclamation marks is common in written Mandarin and in some Yue speaking regions.[23] The Canton and Hong Kong regions, however, generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations; however, an exclamation mark, including in some written representations of colloquy in Cantonese, can be used informally to indicate strong feeling.

It is called 感叹号 in China and 感嘆號 in Taiwan, both pronounced "Gǎn tàn hào".

In Modern Greek, the exclamation mark (Θαυμαστικό, thavmastikó) has been introduced from Latin scripts and is used identically, although without the reluctance seen in English usage.[24] A minor grammatical difference is that, while a series of interjections each employ an exclamation mark (e.g., Ωχ! Αχ!, Ōch! Ach!, 'Oops! Oh!'), an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by a comma (e.g., Ωχ, ξέχασα το μάτι της κουζίνας ανοιχτό!, Ōch, xéchasa to máti tīs kouzínas anoichtó!, 'Oops! I left the stove on.').

In Hungarian, an exclamation mark is put at the end of exclamations, imperative or prohibitive sentences, and sentences expressing a wish (e.g. De szép! – 'How beautiful!', A fűre lépni tilos! – 'Keep off the grass', Bárcsak sikerülne a tervem! – 'If only my plan had worked out.').
The use of the exclamation mark is also needed when addressing someone and the addressing is a separate sentence. (typically at the beginning of letters, e.g. Kedves Péter! – 'Dear Peter,').[25]
Greetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark (e.g. Jó estét! – 'Good evening.').

In Spanish, a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an inverted exclamation mark (the same also applies to the question mark): ¿Estás loco? ¡Casi la matas!, 'Are you crazy? You almost killed her!'

As in British English, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at a statement: Dice que esta noche no va a salir de fiesta (!), 'He said that he's not going to a party tonight(!).' Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark.

In Turkish, an exclamation mark is used after a sentence or phrase for emphasis, and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Ordular! İlk hedefiniz Akdenizdir, ileri! ('Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean') order by Atatürk, ordular ('the armies') constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses, (!), after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm: Çok iyi bir iş yaptın (!), 'You've done a very good job – Not!'.

In Limbu, an exclamation mark is used after a Limbu sentence or phrase for emphasis, and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Limbu sentence ᤐᤚᤢ᥄ ᤄᤨᤘᤑ ᤂᤥᤆᤌᤙ Mediterranean, ᤚᤦᤛᤅ᥄ — Paṡu! Ghōwapha khōcathaśa Mediterranean, ṡausaṅa! (Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean!). It is further used in parentheses, (᥄), after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm: ᤖᤥᤂᤌ ᤔᤚᤗ ᤐᤤ ᤊᤇ ᤃᤦᤄ (᥄) — Rōkhatha maṡala pai yancha gaugha (!) (You did a very good job — Not!).

In Khoisan languages, and the International Phonetic Alphabet, the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the postalveolar click sound (represented as q in Zulu orthography). In Unicode, this letter is properly coded as U+01C3 ǃ LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol U+0021 ! EXCLAMATION MARK to allow software to deal properly with word breaks.

The exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a phonetic symbol to indicate that a consonant is ejective. More commonly this is represented by an apostrophe, or a superscript glottal stop symbol (U+02C0 ˀ MODIFIER LETTER GLOTTAL STOP).

Although not part of dictionary words, exclamation marks appear in some brand names and trade names, including Yum! Brands (parent of fast food chains like  Taco Bell and KFC) and Web services Yahoo! and Joomla!, online game Kahoot!. It appears in the titles of stage and screen works, especially comedies and musicals; examples include the game show Jeopardy!; the '60s musical TV show Shindig!; musicals  Oklahoma!, Oliver! and Oh! Calcutta!; and movies Airplane! and Moulin Rouge!. Writer Elliot S! Maggin and cartoonist Scott Shaw! include exclamation marks in their names. In the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Republican candidate Jeb Bush used "Jeb!" as his campaign logo.

The English town of Westward Ho!, named after the novel by Charles Kingsley, is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark.[26] There is a town in Quebec called Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, which is spelled with two exclamation marks.[27] The city of Hamilton, Ohio, changed its name to Hamilton! in 1986, but neither the United States Board on Geographic Names nor mapmakers Rand McNally recognised the change.[28]  The city of Ostrava, Czech Republic, changed its logotype to Ostrava!!! in 2008.[29]

Exclamation marks are used to emphasize a precautionary statement.

On warning signs, an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to a warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle with a red border is common on European road warning signs.



In  elementary mathematics, the symbol represents the factorial operation. The expression n! means "the product of the integers from 1 to n".  For example, 4! (read four factorial) is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. (0! is defined as 1,[30] which is a neutral element in multiplication, not multiplied by anything.) Additionally, it can also represent the uniqueness quantifier or, if used in front of a number, it can represent a subfactorial.

In linear logic, the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction.

In computing, the exclamation mark is ASCII character 33 (21 in hexadecimal). Due to its availability on even early computers, the character was used for many purposes. The name given to "!" by programmers varies according to their background, though it was very common to give it a short name to make reading code aloud easier. "Bang"[31] is very popular. In the UK the term pling was popular in the earlier days of computing, whilst in the United States, the term shriek was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and shriek is from Stanford or MIT; however, shriek for the ! sign is found in the Oxford English Dictionary dating from the 1860s.

Many computer languages using C-style syntax use "!" for logical negation; !A means "not A", and A != B means "A is not equal to B". This negation principle has spread to ordinary language; for example, the word "!clue" is used as a synonym for "no-clue" or "clueless".[32][33] The symbol in formal logic for negation is ¬ but, as this symbol is not present as standard on some keyboards, the C convention has spread informally to other contexts.

Early e-mail systems also used the exclamation mark as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as "bang path" notation.

In the IRC protocol, a user's nickname and ident are separated by an exclamation mark in the hostmask assigned to him or her by the server.

In UNIX scripting (typically for UNIX shell or Perl), "!" is usually used after a "#" in the first line of a script, the interpreter directive, to tell the OS what program to use to run the script.  #! is usually called a "hash-bang" or shebang. A similar convention for PostScript files calls for the first line to begin with %!, called "percent-bang".[34]

An exclamation mark starts history expansions in many Unix shells such as bash and tcsh where !! executes the previous command and !* refers to all of the arguments from the previous command.

Acorn RISC OS uses filenames starting with pling to create an application directory: for instance a file called !Run is executed when the folder containing it is double-clicked (holding down shift prevents this). There is also !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), !Sprites (icons), !Help, and others.

In APL, !x is used for factorial of x (backwards from math notation), and also for the binomial coefficient: k!n means 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

 or n!⁄k!(n–k)!.

BBC BASIC used pling as an indirection operator, equivalent to PEEK and POKE of four bytes at once.[35]

BCPL, the precursor of C, used "!" for pointer and array indirection: !P is equivalent to *P in C, and P!3 is equivalent to P[3] in C.

In the Haskell programming language, "!" is used to express strictness.

In the Kotlin programming language, "!!" ("double-bang") is the not-null assertion operator, used to override null safety so as to allow a null pointer exception.[36]

In the ML programming language (including Standard ML and OCaml), "!" is the operator to get the value out of a "reference" data structure.

In the Raku programming language, the "!" twigil is used to access private attributes or methods in a class (like class Person { has $!name; } or self!private-method;).[37]

In the Scheme,[38] Julia,[39] and Ruby programming languages, "!" is conventionally the suffix for functions and special forms that mutate their input.

In the Swift programming language, a type followed by "!" denotes an "implicitly unwrapped optional", an option type where the compiler does not enforce safe unwrapping. The "!" operator "force unwraps" an option type, causing an error if it is nil.

In Geek Code version 3, "!" is used before a letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as G! denoting a geek of no qualifications, !d denoting not wearing any clothes, P! denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations, however.

The exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that a character is startled or alarmed. In the Metal Gear and Paper Mario series, an exclamation mark appears over enemies' heads when they notice the player.

In massively multiplayer online (MMO) games such as World of Warcraft, an exclamation mark hovering over a character's head indicates that they are offering a quest for the player to complete.

In Dota 2, an exclamation mark is shown above the head of a unit if it is killed by means not granting enemies experience or gold (if it is "denied").

In the 2005 arcade dance simulation game In the Groove 2, there is a song titled "!" (also referred to as "bang") by the artist Onyx.

In recent Internet culture, especially where leet is used, multiple exclamation marks may be affixed with the numeral "1" as in !!!!!!111. The notation originates from a common error: when typing multiple exclamation points quickly, the typist may fail to hold the ⇧ Shift1 combination that produces the exclamation mark on many keyboard layouts. This error, first used intentionally as a joke in the leet linguistic community, is now an accepted form of exclamation in leet and derivative dialects such as Lolspeak.[40] Some utterances include further substitutions, for example "!!!111oneeleven".[41]

In fandom and fanfiction, ! is used to signify a defining quality in a character, usually signifying an alternative interpretation of a character from a canonical work. Examples of this would be "Romantic!Draco" or "Vampire!Harry" from Harry Potter fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of a character with multiple identities or appearances, such as to distinguish "Armor!Al" from "Human!Al" in a work based on Fullmetal Alchemist. The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, for example, "Football Player! Leonardo", "Rockstar! Raphael", and "Breakdancer! Michelangelo".[citation needed]

Some comic books, especially superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.[42]

Comic book writer Elliot S! Maggin once accidentally signed his name with an exclamation due to the habit of using them when writing comic scripts; it became his professional name from then on.[43][44] Similarly, comic artist Scott Shaw! has used the exclamation point after his name throughout his career.

In comic books and comics in general, a large exclamation point is often used near or over a character's head to indicate surprise.  A question mark can similarly be used to indicate confusion.

In chess notation "!" denotes a good move, "!!" denotes an excellent move, "?!" denotes a dubious move, and "!?" denotes an interesting, risky move.  In some chess variants such as large-board Shogi variants, "!" is used to record pieces capturing by stationary feeding or burning.

In Scrabble, an exclamation mark written after a word is used to indicate its presence in the Official Tournament and Club Word List but its absence from the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, usually because the word has been judged offensive.

Exclamation points or asterisks can be used on scorecards to denote a "great defensive play".[45]

The band !!! (pronounced "Chk Chk Chk") uses exclamation points as its name.[46]

In 2008, the pop-punk band Panic! at the Disco dropped the exclamation point in its name; this became the "most-discussed topic on [fan] message boards around the world".[47] In 2009, the exclamation mark was re-inserted following the band's split.[48]

The band Bomb the Music Industry! utilizes an exclamation mark in its name, as well as several album and song titles and promotional material. Examples include their songs "(Shut) Up The Punx!!!" and the album Adults!!!: Smart!!! Shithammered!!! And Excited by Nothing!!!!!!!.

American musician Pink stylizes her stage name "P!NK",[49] and uses three exclamation points in the subtitle of her 2010 release, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.[50]

The exclamation mark was included in the title of Dinah Shore's TV series, Dinah! The exclamation mark was later the subject of a bitter argument between Elaine Benes and her boyfriend, Jake Jarmel, in the Seinfeld episode, "The Sniffing Accountant". Elaine got upset with Jake for not putting an exclamation mark at the end of a message about her friend having a baby. Jake took extreme exception to the trivial criticism and broke up with Elaine, putting an exclamation mark after his parting words: "I'm leaving!"

In musicals, an exclamation mark is usually used when the title of the show has the same title of a song within the act. Examples of this are shows like Oklahoma! and Mamma Mia!.[citation needed]

Related forms have these code points:

Some scripts have their own exclamation mark:

The inverted question mark, ¿, and inverted exclamation mark, ¡, are punctuation marks used to begin interrogative and exclamatory sentences or clauses in Spanish and some languages which have cultural ties with Spain, such as the Galician, Asturian and Waray languages.[1] The initial marks are mirrored at the end of the sentence or clause by the 'ordinary' question mark, ?, or exclamation mark, !.

Inverted marks are supported by various standards, including ISO-8859-1, Unicode, and HTML. They can be entered directly on keyboards designed for Spanish-speaking countries.

The inverted question mark ¿ is written before the first letter of an interrogative sentence or clause to indicate that a question follows. It is a rotated form of the standard symbol "?" recognized by speakers of other languages written with the Latin alphabet. A normal question mark is written at the end of the sentence or clause.

Inverted punctuation is especially critical in Spanish since the syntax of the language means that both statements and questions or exclamations could have the same wording.[2] "Do you like summer?" and "You like summer." are translated respectively as "¿Te gusta el verano?" and "Te gusta el verano." (There is not always a difference between the wording of a yes–no question and the corresponding statement in Spanish.)

In sentences that are both declarative and interrogative, the clause that asks a question is isolated with the starting-symbol inverted question mark, for example: "Si no puedes ir con ellos, ¿quieres ir con nosotros?" ("If you cannot go with them, would you like to go with us?"), not "¿Si no puedes ir con ellos, quieres ir con nosotros?" This helps to recognize questions and exclamations in long sentences.

Unlike the ending marks, which are printed along the baseline of the text, the inverted marks (¿ and ¡) descend below the line.

In 1668, John Wilkins proposed using the inverted exclamation mark "¡" as a symbol at the end of a sentence to denote irony. He was one of many, including Desiderius Erasmus, who felt there was a need for such a punctuation mark, but Wilkins' proposal, as was true of the other attempts, failed to take hold.[3][4]

Inverted marks were originally recommended by the Real Academia Española (Royal Spanish Academy), published in the second edition of the Ortografía de la lengua castellana (Orthography of the Castilian language) in 1754[5] recommending it as the symbol indicating the beginning of a question in written Spanish—e.g. "¿Cuántos años tienes?" ("How old are you?"). The Real Academia also ordered the same inverted-symbol system for statements of exclamation, using the symbols "¡" and "!".

These new rules were slowly adopted; there are 19th-century books in which the writer uses neither "¡" nor "¿".[citation needed]

Some writers omit the inverted question mark in the case of a short unambiguous question such as: "Quién viene?" ("Who comes?"). This is the criterion in Galician[6] [7] and formerly in Catalan.[8] Certain Catalan-language authorities, such as Joan Solà i Cortassa, insist that both the opening and closing question marks be used for clarity.[citation needed] The current IEC prescription for Catalan is not to use the inverted marks.[9]

Some Spanish-language writers, among them Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda (1904–1973), refuse to use the inverted question mark.[10]

It is common on social media to omit the inverted question mark since it saves typing time. Some also use the ending symbol for both beginning and ending, like this: "?Por qué dices eso?". Others may even use both the opening and closing question marks, but at the end of the sentence, giving "Por qué dices eso¿?" or "Por qué dices eso?¿". Given the informal setting, this might be unimportant; however, teachers[who?] see this as a problem, fearing and claiming that contemporary young students are inappropriately and incorrectly extending the practice to academic homework and essays. (See Internet linguistics § Educational perspective.)

It is acceptable in Spanish to begin a sentence with an opening inverted exclamation mark ("¡") and end it with a question mark ("?"), or vice versa, for statements that are questions but also have a clear sense of exclamation or surprise such as: ¡Y tú quién te crees? ("And who do you think you are?!"). Normally, four signs are used, always with one type in the outer side and the other in the inner side (nested) (¿¡Y tú quién te crees!?, ¡¿Y tú quién te crees?![11])

Unicode 5.1 also includes U+2E18 ⸘ INVERTED INTERROBANG, which is an inverted version of the interrobang, a nonstandard punctuation mark used to denote both excitement and a question in one glyph. It is also known as a "gnaborretni" (/ŋˌnɑːbɔːrˈɛt.ni/) (interrobang spelled backwards).

¡ and ¿ are both located within the Unicode Common block, and are both inherited from ISO-8859-1:

The characters also appear in most extended ASCII encodings.

In Windows, an inverted question mark is valid in a file or directory name, whereas the normal question mark is a reserved character which cannot be used.

¿ and ¡ are available in all keyboard layouts for Spanish-speaking countries. Smart phones typically offer these if you hold down ? or ! in the on-screen keyboard. Auto-correct will often turn a normal mark typed at the start of a sentence to the inverted one.

On systems with an AltGr key (actual or emulated via right Alt key) and Extended ( or 'International') keyboard mapping set, the symbols can be accessed directly, though the sequence varies by OS and locality: for example on Windows and US-International, use AltGr+1 and AltGr+/; on Chrome OS with UK-Extended, use AltGr+⇧ Shift+1 and AltGr+⇧ Shift+-.

An exclamation point (!) is a mark of punctuation used after a word, phrase, or sentence that expresses a strong emotion. It ends emphatic statements, says "English Grammar & Punctuation," a reference guide. William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White, in their famous "Elements of Style," say that: "The exclamation mark is to be reserved for after true exclamations and commands." And "Merriam-Webster's Guide to Punctuation and Style" notes that the exclamation point is used "to mark a forceful comment or exclamation." It is also called an exclamation mark or tellingly, in newspaper jargon, a shriek.


These sources and others may define it with different vocabulary, but they all agree on one thing: The exclamation point is possibly the most overused punctuation mark in the English language. Multiple exclamation points (or marks)—two or, often, three exclamation marks (!!!) following a word or sentence—should be even rarer still in good writing.


The exclamation point was first used by printers at the end of the 15th century, according to Thomas MacKellar, in his 1885 book, "The American Printer: A Manual of Typography." MacKellar also noted that the punctuation meant "admiration or exclamation" as well as "surprise, astonishment, rapture, and the like sudden emotions of the mind." The mark, itself, comes from Latin, says Smithsonian.com:


It wasn’t until 1970 that the exclamation point had its own key on the keyboard, the Smithsonian notes, adding that before that you had to type a period, and then use the backspace to go back and stick an apostrophe above it.


When executives dictated to secretaries, they would say "bang" to indicate the exclamation point, leading to the term interbang, a nonstandard punctuation mark in the form of a question mark superimposed on an exclamation point (sometimes appearing as ?!). It is used to end a rhetorical question or a simultaneous question and exclamation. Some writers, then, began using multiple exclamation points as a logical outgrowth of the interbang and single exclamation mark to add even more emphasis to words, phrases, and sentences.


The use of the exclamation point—and, even more so, multiple exclamation points—has been met with plenty of controversy and criticism. Smithsonian notes this less-than-pleased response by F. Scott Fitzgerald to the use of multiple exclamation points:


Author Elmore Leonard was even more incensed by their use:


Leonard also said that use of multiple exclamation points is the "sign of a diseased mind." Still, exclamation points do have a purpose in the English language, according to the late Rene "Jack" Cappon, a longtime editor at the Associated Press and author of "The Associated Press Guide to Punctuation." Cappon said that exclamation points are certainly not subtle; instead, they act like a "kettle drum," noisily calling readers' attention to a given word, phrase, or sentence. Echoing the very earliest use of this punctuation mark, Cappon says you should use exclamation points to convey pain, fear, astonishment, anger, and disgust, as in:


Cappon notes that you rarely run into emotional outbursts like these, so you should use single or multiple exclamation points sparingly. He and other grammar and punctuation experts point out that you should generally let the words speak for themselves, set off by a simple period, comma, or semicolon. Otherwise, you risk damaging your credibility by constantly yelling at your readers, similar to someone screaming "fire" in a crowded theater, even when there is not a hint of smoke.


Richard Bullock, Michal Brody, and Francine Weinberg note in the "The Little Seagull Handbook," a grammar, punctuation, and style guide used on many college campuses, that you should use exclamation points to express strong emotion or add emphasis to a statement or command. They give this example of when to use an exclamation point, from Susan Jane Gilman's "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress: Tales of Growing Up Groovy and Clueless," who described seeing "The Rolling Stones" band member Keith Richards:


Encountering a member of the iconic rock band—and the shrieking that accompanied the sighting—would, indeed, call for at least one exclamation point—and perhaps more!!!—to emphasize the excitement of the moment. Another example of when to use exclamation points is illustrated in this pithy quote from Tennessee Williams in "Camino Real."


You can also use multiple exclamation points in informal or comic writing, or to express sarcasm, as in:


The point is that the writer of the above sentences didn't really love the email. She was being ironic, which the multiple exclamation points help to show. Additionally, David Crystal, in "Making a Point: The Persnickety Story of English Punctuation," gives these examples where the contexts dictate when exclamation marks would be acceptable, even expected:


But there are many other instances where you should omit exclamation points, as in this example from "The Little Seagull Handbook."


Bill Walsh, the late copy chief for the Washington Post, noted in "The Elephants of Style: A Trunkload of Tips on the Big Issues and Gray Areas of Contemporary American English" that you should omit exclamation points (and other punctuation marks) when they are, essentially, gimmicky "decorations" for company names. So, says Walsh, you would write Yahoo, not Yahoo!


"The Associated Press Stylebook" also notes that you place exclamation points within quote marks when they are part of the quoted material, as in:


But place exclamation points outside of quotation marks when they are not part of the quoted material:


And never use other punctuation marks, such as a comma, after an exclamation point:


So, when using exclamation points remember that less is more. Use this punctuation mark—whether it be one, two, or three exclamation points—only when the context calls for it. Otherwise, let your prose speak for themselves and save the mighty exclamation point for extreme circumstances, for heaven's sake!!!

The exclamation point, also called an exclamation mark, is a punctuation mark that goes at the end of certain sentences. It’s less common than the period or question mark, but it’s very easy to use. Some might say it’s too easy to use.
Periods go at the end of declarative sentences, question marks go at the end of interrogative sentences, and exclamation points go at the end of exclamatory sentences. An exclamatory sentence is one that expresses a strong or forceful emotion, such as anger, surprise, or joy.
Here’s a tip:  Want to make sure your writing always looks great? Grammarly can save you from misspellings, grammatical and punctuation mistakes, and other writing issues on all your favorite websites. 



I got a perfect score on the SAT!
Get out of my sight!


Exclamation points are also commonly found with sentence fragments or sudden interjections. Occasionally, you might see one at the end of a sentence that is phrased as a question.

Careful! That spider is poisonous.
Holy cow!
How could I have forgotten to pack underwear!


Using an exclamation point is usually quite simple—you just put it at the end of the sentence. But it can get a little tricky when you also have a quotation mark at the end of the sentence. Here are the rules:
Put the exclamation point inside the closing quotation marks if it applies to the words enclosed by the quotation marks.

“There’s a spider on my arm!” yelped Jeremy.


If the exclamation point applies to the sentence as a whole, then place it at the very end.

And then the paramedics tried to tell Jeremy it was “only a spider”!


Put the exclamation point inside the parentheses when it applies to the words inside the parentheses.

Jeremy didn’t find out until later what kind of spider it was (a black widow!).


Put the exclamation point outside the parentheses if it applies to the whole sentence.

They settled out of court and Jeremy got a million dollars (cash)!


Using exclamation points and parentheses this way is relatively rare.
The hardest thing about using an exclamation point is probably knowing when not to use one. In writing, it’s often hard to convey the emotion and intent behind a simple statement. If you spoke the words “I can’t believe you threw me a surprise party” aloud, it would be clear from the tone of your voice and body language whether you meant this as an expression of gratitude or reproach. An exclamation point can help make it clear by conveying your excitement: “I can’t believe you threw me a surprise party!”
But using too many exclamation marks makes them less effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald said that using exclamation marks is like laughing at your own jokes. After a while, your readers will simply ignore them, or worse, become annoyed by them. On top of that, they’re considered to be relatively casual, so using them in business or formal academic writing is a no-no. Instead of relying on exclamation points to convey your urgency or excitement, use more vivid vocabulary. Instead of “Make sure you finish this by tomorrow morning!” try “It’s crucial that you finish this before tomorrow morning’s deadline.”
Congratulations! You just learned everything you need to know about exclamation points.

The most flagrant way a writer demonstrates contempt for his readers is by ignoring punctuation altogether. A close second is the abundant use of the exclamation point. Some writers even use three or more exclamation points, lest the reader not fully grasp the significance of what is being said.
To be effective, the exclamation point should be used in moderation.
The exclamation point is a mark of terminal punctuation. As such, it should not be followed by a period or question mark. Some writers will use both a question mark and exclamation point for an exclamatory question, but only the exclamation point is truly necessary.
What in the world are you doing up there!
What in the world are you doing up there?!
There is a punctuation mark that combines the question mark and exclamation point. It is called the interrobang, and it looks like this: â½ Yet, for reasons already explained, it is hardly needed.
The greatest confusion arises when exclamation points and other punctuation marks appear at the end of a sentence. For examples of most such pairings, see the terminal punctuation chart.
When a quotation ends with an exclamation point, a comma that would ordinarily be placed inside the closing quotation mark is omitted.
âGet out,â Marcus said.
âGet out!â Marcus yelled.
âGet out!,â Marcus yelled.
If the exclamation point is part of a title of work or a proper noun, the comma should be retained.
His latest short story, âDonât Make a Sound!,â is his most suspenseful yet.
Her first novel, Excite!, was a critical hit.
After five years in the sales department at Yahoo!, he took a marketing job at Google.
Writers sometimes place an exclamation point in brackets to indicate their surprise or amusement at something being quoted. Avoid this in formal writing.
